CoLib
=

CoLib is a control flow library designed to simplify writing complex timed logic
in Unity. The library is modular and highly extensible, making heavy use of closures.
It's design is similar to the Cocos2d and LibGDX Action systems.

This repository contains the CoLib tests as well as the CoLib library.
The tests depend on the Unity Test Tools framework, which can be downloaded from the Unity asset store.
An introduction to usage of the library can be found [here](/colib/README.md).
